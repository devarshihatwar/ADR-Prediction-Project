AI-Powered Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Prediction

Model Used: Random Forest with MultiOutputClassifier

Accuracy: 0.1910
F1 Score (micro): 0.9492
Hamming Loss: 0.0955

This project uses machine learning to predict potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) based on the SMILES structure of chemical compounds.
RDKit was used to convert chemical structures into molecular fingerprints.
The model helps in pharmacovigilance by identifying ADRs before clinical events.
